These tools take content written in jupyter notebook (.ipynb extension) and markdown text files (.md extension) to transform text, math input, and python code, into the nicely rendered HTML code of this website.  Some of the notebooks that embed code can then be run on a jupyter notebook server on the users’ personal computer, or in the cloud, to make some of the visualizations and simulations interactive.\n\nSome pages contain \n\ngeogebra applets that are immediately interactive in any modern browser.   Other pages which have been created as jupyter notebooks with embedded  python code will display as static pages but can be modified and made interactive by running the the jupyter notebook on a server.  This can be accomplished by clicking the Binder or Google Colab button at the top of the page, or by cloning the \n\nEcon-Teach github repository to your local computer and then running them on a local jupyter notebook server.  Here is one \n\nguide to getting started.\n\nMost users can interact with the content without having to learn how the entire ‘book/website’ was built. What follows are a few pointers and tips only for those who might be curious about how to build a similar site.","type":"content","url":"/how-top","position":1},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"This JupyterBook","lvl2":"Concepts"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/how-top#concepts","position":2},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"This JupyterBook","lvl2":"Concepts"},"content":"The aim is to create content using easy human-readable \n\nmarkdown in combination with python (or other coding languages) to explore ideas and create scientific content with simulations and visualizations and to then convert this via a nice looking rendered website and/or to other intermediary or final formats such as Latex, PDF, etc.  In short, we want to get a nice looking website and ‘book’ content for sharing reproducible research without having to learn (too much) HTML/CSS, Latex or other technical content.\n\nJupyter notebooks already accomplish much of this goal by themselves by providing a ‘front end’ for mixing text, math and code.  Jupyter notebooks that are posted to sites such as github are automatically rendered by those sites in human readable form (see, for example, \n\nEdgeworth.ipynb).  This however allows one to only display one notebook at a time and for a larger project one would want to organize several notebooks and markdown files into a clearly navigable book or website.\n\nJupyterbook was created for this purpose as part of \n\nThe Executable Book Project.  Many Executable Books and Courses are being written using Jupyterbook. See the \n\nGallery of Jupyter Books.  Some of the peopl behind the \n\nQuantecon project were important to the development of Jupyter Book.\n\nJupyterbook extends the simple markdown syntax typically used for jupyter notebooks by adding extra \n\nMyST Markdown ‘directives’ and ‘roles’ to allow us several ‘book writing’ tasks including adding bibliographic citations and bibliographies, numberering equations, adding cross-references, creating tabs and dropdowns, etc. MyST also gives us more fine control over things such as image size and positioning on a page, figure captioning, hiding code, etc.","type":"content","url":"/how-top#concepts","position":3},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"This JupyterBook","lvl2":"Setup and Build"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/how-top#setup-and-build","position":4},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"This JupyterBook","lvl2":"Setup and Build"},"content":"See installation instructions on the \n\njupyter book page.

The model is relatively easy to analyze -- it can be described compactly in terms of diagrams and yet is very rich in predictions.  In its simplest formulation there are two production sectors, say Agriculture and Manufacturing, with a linear homogenous (CRS) production technology in each sector. Production in each sector requires labor -- a mobile factor that can freely move between sectorsr -- as well as a factor specific to each sector, for example land T in agriculture and capital K of a specific kind in manufacturing. The model can be summarized as:\n\n\\begin{aligned}\nQ_a &= F(\\bar T, L_a) \\\\\nQ_m &= G(\\bar K, L_m) \\\\\n\\bar{L} &=  L_a + L_m\n\\end{aligned}\n\nThe model can be used to demonstrate gains to trade as well as how the distribution of incomes may change in response to changes in relative product prices, or changes in factor endowments.  The Specific Factors Model predicts that, in the absence of political redistribution mechanisms, specific factors in declining sectors will organize strong opposition to policies that might otherwise raise growth.  Variants of the model show up as models of rural to urban migration, adaptations of the Lewis model and other dual sector models of sectoral (mis)allocation.  The latter includes models such as the Harris-Todaro model that explains rural-urban migration, urban-bias and the growth of the urban informal sector.\n\nThe initial distribution of factor ownership and the degree of asset specificity may make a big difference in terms of what types of political coalitions mobilize for and against different policies.  This is the basic driving force in many political-economy models including Moav-Galor’s (2006)cleverly titled “Das Human Kapital” growth model on why some regions made public investments in human capital which sped the transition from agriculture to manufacturing and enhanced growth, whereas similar policies were delayed in places where political/economic resistance was stronger --  for instance where landlords had stronger voice in political decisions.\n\nThe Specific Factors (SF) or Ricardo-Viner model is a close relative of the Hecksher-Ohlin-Samuelson (HOS) neoclassical trade model. The 2x2 HOS model assumes production in each of two sectors takes place by firms using constant returns to scale technologies with capital and labor as inputs and that both capital and labor are mobile across sectors. In the SF model only labor is inter-sectorally mobile and the fixed amounts of capital become ‘specific’ to the sector they are trapped within.\n\nIn effect the SF model therefore consists of three factors of production: mobile labor and two types of capital, one specific to each sector.  Let’s label the two sectors are Agriculture and Manufacturing. In agriculture competitive firms bid to hire land and labor. In manufacturing competitive firms bid to hire capital and labor. Each factor of production will be competitively priced in equilibrium but only labor is priced on a national labor market.\n\nThe SF model is often described as a short-run version of the HOS model.  For example suppose we start with a HOS model equilibrium where labor wage and rental rate of capital have equalized across sectors (which also implies marginal products are equalized across sectors -- no productivity differences across sectors).  Now suppose that the relative price of manufacturing products suddenly rises (due to a change of world price, or government trade protection or other policies that favor manufacturing).  The higher relative product price should lead firms in the booming manufacturing sector to demand both more capital and labor. Correspondingly, demand for land and labor decline in the agricultural sector.  In the short run however only labor can be move from agriculture to manufacturing.  Agricultural workers can become factory workers but agricultural capital (say ‘land’ or ‘tractors’) cannot be easily converted to manufacturing capital (say ‘weaving machines’). So labor moves from manufacturing to the agriculture, lowering the capital labor ratio in manufacturing and raising the land to labor ratio in agriculture.  The model thus predicts a surge in the real return to capital in the expanding sector and a real decline in the real return to capital in agriculture (land).  Hence the measured average and marginal product of capital will now diverge across sectors.  What happens to the real wage is more ambiguous: it rises measured in terms of purchasing power over agricultural goods but falls in terms of purchasing power over manufacturing goods.   Whether workers are better off or worse off following this price/policy change therefore comes down to how important agricultural and manufacturing goods are in their consumption basket. This result is labeled the neo-classical ambiguity.\n\nOver the longer-term weaving machines cannot be transformed into tractors but over time new capital accumulation will build tractors and old weaving machines can be sold overseas or as scrap metal. Hence over time more capital will arrive into the manufacturing sector and leave the agricultural sector, whcih in turn will lead to even more movement of labor to manufacturing.
