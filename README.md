# teaching

A slow growing repository for placing jupyter notebooks that I may have used for teaching economics at Hunter College and The Graduate Center at CUNY, and elsewhere.

These Jupyter Notebooks vary in quality from crude to more polished. I've organized them loosely into notebooks sub-folders

[intro](notebooks/intro)  -- Eco 100 and Eco 200 Intro to micro

[Trade](notebooks/trade)  -- Eco 340 and Eco 740 Trade models

[micro](notebooks/micro)  -- Eco 701 Micro Theory models


Notebooks for other courses (housed at other repositories):

[PhD Development seminar](https://dev-ii-seminar.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)  -- PhD development seminar at The Graduate Center

[Land property rights](https://github.com/jhconning/land_uct_2019)  -- for a short course on political economy of land in Cape Town 2019

You see only a static representation of the notebooks here.  You can run most of these notebooks via a jupyter cloud server such as [google colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/welcome.ipynb), or on your own local machine running a jupyter server.

Many of the notebooks run as [Voila apps](https://voila.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).  You'll see text, graphs, and live widget sliders to move things around on some notebooks but the code is hidden. To see these apps click [here](https://ricardian.herokuapp.com/), choose the notebook you want to see as an app (and give it some time to set things up before interacting).
