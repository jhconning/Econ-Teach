# Jupyter Notebooks for Trade Models

This is a collection of [jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) for a few key economic models taught in micro and international trade courses. Some notebooks are relatively complete and polished, others more like first drafts, but all aim to explain and interactively animate classic models using widgets such as sliders (built upon the python [ipywidgets](https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/ipywidgets) library).

These notebooks may be simply viewed (just click on links in this code repository). 

I've also setup a voila 'web app' version of these notebooks at https://ricardian.herokuapp.com/ 
Click on any of the listed notebooks and (after allowing a few moments for things to load) and you can use sliders to change parameters and animate the graphs (all code will be hidden).
