# teaching

A repository for placing jupyter notebooks that I may have used for teaching economics at Hunter College.

These Jupyter Notebooks vary in quality from crude to more polished. I've organized them loosely in two folders

[intro](notebooks/intro)  -- Eco 100 and Eco 200 Intro to micro

[Trade](notebooks/trade)  -- Eco 340 and Eco 740 Trade models

[micro](notebooks/micro)  -- Eco 701 Micro Theory models


Notebooks for other courses (housed at other repositories):

[PhD Development seminar](https://dev-ii-seminar.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)  -- PhD development seminar at The Graduate Center

[Land property rights](https://github.com/jhconning/land_uct_2019)  -- for a short course on political economy of land in Cape Town 2019

You see only a static representation of the notebooks here.  You can run most of these notebooks via a jupyter cloud server such as [google colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/welcome.ipynb), or on your own local machine running a jupyter server.
