# teaching

A repository for placing jupyter notebooks that I may have used for teaching economics at Hunter College. 

These Jupyter Notebooks vary in quality from crude to more polished. I've organized them loosely in two folders

[Intro](intro)  -- Eco 100 and Eco 200 Intro to micro

[Trade](trade)  -- Eco 340 and Eco 740 Trade models

[Micro](Micro)  -- Eco 701 Micro Theory models
